/**
 * This test plugs together all of the infrastructure, including the order book (which you can trade against)
 * and the market data feed.
 *
 * If your algo adds orders to the book, they will reflect in your market data coming back from the order book.
 *
 * If you cross the spread (i.e. you BUY an order with a price which is == or > askPrice()) you will match, and receive
 * a fill back into your order from the order book (visible from the algo in the childOrders of the state object.
 *
 * If you cancel the order your child order will show the order status as cancelled in the childOrders of the state object.

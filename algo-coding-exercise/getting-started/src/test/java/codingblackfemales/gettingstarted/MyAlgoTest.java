 * This test is designed to check your algo behavior in isolation of the order book.
 *
 * You can tick in market data messages by creating new versions of createTick() (ex. createTick2, createTickMore etc..)
 *
 * You should then add behaviour to your algo to respond to that market data by creating or cancelling child orders.
 *
 * When you are comfortable you algo does what you expect, then you can move on to creating the MyAlgoBackTest.

    // Step 1: Gather historical price data for a specific stock.
// This data should include the closing prices for each day.

// Step 2: Calculate the rate of change (ROC) for each day.
// ROC = ((Today's Closing Price - Closing Price N days ago) / Closing Price N days ago) * 100

// Step 3: Determine a threshold value to trigger buying or selling.
// For example, if ROC is positive and greater than a certain value, we'll consider buying.
// If ROC is negative and less than a certain value, we'll consider selling.

// Step 4: Initialize variables for tracking our position in the stock.
// Let's say we start with no stock (position = 0).

// Step 5: Loop through each day's data from the most recent to the oldest:
// - Calculate the ROC for the current day.
// - If ROC is above the threshold and we don't have a position (position == 0), then buy the stock.
// - If ROC is below the negative threshold and we have a position, then sell the stock.
// - Keep track of our position (position = 1 for holding stock, 0 for no position).

// Step 6: Continue looping through historical data.

// Step 7: When you reach the end of the historical data, your trading strategy is complete.

// Step 8: You can evaluate the strategy's performance by checking how much money you made or lost
// based on your buy and sell decisions.

// Step 9: Remember that this is a simplified example, and real-world trading involves many more
// complexities, such as transaction costs, risk management, and market conditions.

// Step 10: Be careful when using real money in trading, and consider testing your strategy in a
// paper trading or simulated environment first.

### Main Objective Solution

* [MyAlgoLogic.java](https://github.com/tosimiadesoye/OrderMatchingAlgo/blob/MovingAverage/algo-coding-exercise/getting-started/src/main/java/codingblackfemales/gettingstarted/MyAlgoLogic.java): My main objective creates 5 Child orders and cancels them.
* [MyAlgoBackTest.java](https://github.com/tosimiadesoye/OrderMatchingAlgo/blob/MovingAverage/algo-coding-exercise/getting-started/src/test/java/codingblackfemales/gettingstarted/MyAlgoBackTest.java):  This is testing the current view of the child orders I've created, checking if they have been filled or cancelled etc.
* [MyAlgoTest.java](https://github.com/tosimiadesoye/OrderMatchingAlgo/blob/MovingAverage/algo-coding-exercise/getting-started/src/test/java/codingblackfemales/gettingstarted/MyAlgoTest.java): This is testing for the same thing as MyAlgoBackTest.


**Stretch objective Solution:** 

* [MovingAverage.java](https://github.com/tosimiadesoye/OrderMatchingAlgo/blob/MovingAverage/algo-coding-exercise/getting-started/src/main/java/codingblackfemales/gettingstarted/MovingAverage.java): This class implements a trading algorithm based on Moving Averages. It processes historical price data to make informed buying and selling decisions. The algorithm is designed to take advantage of price trends, aiming to buy stocks when prices are declining and sell them when they have appreciated by at least 1% above the purchase price. By utilising Moving Averages, it seeks to identify potential opportunities for profit by tracking short-term and long-term price trends and executing orders accordingly.
* [MovingAverageBackTest.java](https://github.com/tosimiadesoye/OrderMatchingAlgo/blob/MovingAverage/algo-coding-exercise/getting-started/src/test/java/codingblackfemales/gettingstarted/MovingAverageBackTest.java): This is testing for null and pending orders etc;
